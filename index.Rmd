👋 Hello, my name is Yunbeom Lee.

🎓I am soon to graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Physics and Astronomy from the University of Waterloo (expected December 2024).

🌇 Currently residing in Waterloo, Ontario, I am passionate about utilizing machine learning models to derive insights that enhance business strategies.

📚 I began my undergraduate journey majoring in Science and Aviation with a specialization in Physics. While flying a Cessna 172 was enjoyable, I realized this wasn't the career path I wanted to pursue. During mandatory military service with the US Army in South Korea, I became captivated by using data analysis to enhance professional athletes’ performances. This sparked my decision to pivot towards a career in data science. I supplemented my education in Physics with coding and data analysis courses, aiming to develop proficiency in statistical and machine learning models.

🥇 Looking ahead, I aspire to work as a data scientist in the sports industry, collaborating with performance teams to optimize player proficiency.

⛳️ In my free time, you'll find me on the golf course hitting a 3 wood.
