### 2. Goal
To predict the final price of each car using multiple explanatory variables describing different characteristics of cars manufactured by Geely Auto, aiming to enter the U.S. market and compete with established automotive brands.

<br>

### 3. Methodology & Summary

  + The Random Forest Regressor showed the best performance with a cross-validation R-squared value of 0.9101, Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.02317, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.12166. Random Forest's feature selection revealed that enginesize, curbweight, and horsepower were among the most significant variables contributing to car price predictions.
  + The LASSO regression also performed well, with an R-squared value of 0.9012. The LASSO model naturally handled multicollinearity and included feature selection by eliminating unnecessary variables. The XGBoost model followed closely with an R-squared of 0.8893, representing the potential of boosting techniques in predictive performance.
  + The methodologies tested provided insights into feature importance for car pricing. Despite Random Forest and LASSO being different types of algorithms, combining predictions might further enhance accuracy. However, Random Forest's strong predictive capability, as evidenced by the cross-validation metrics, made it the primary choice for this task.
